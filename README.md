# Kafka Message Tool (KMT)
Simple GUI tool (javaFX) to facilitate sending/receiving messages to/from *Apache Kafka* broker


**Features**
 - Display kafka broker configuration for each node in cluster
 - Show partition assignments to currently connected consumers (in consumer group)
 - Send multi-messages to kafka with scripted content manner (with groovy scripting)
 - Send messages (ProducerRecord) with user provided key
 - Find which topic partition will be chosen by kafka broker to put the message into
 - Each send/receive window can be detached

- ![MessageSenderConfigurationWindow](md.resources/message_sender_config_window.PNG "Message sender window")
- ![MessageListenerConfigurationWindow](md.resources/message_listener_config_window.PNG "Message listener window")

**Build**
- To build the app just execute `build` gradle task. There should be `kafka-message-tool<version>.jar` file created in
`<project_dir>/build/libs` directory

**Run**
 - To run the app just call`java -jar kafka-message-tool-<version>.jar`
 New file with saved settings will appear in the same location as applicaiton jar file. 

**Versioning**
- The versioning scheme is as follows:
  - `<AppVersion>-<MajorPatchVersion>-<MinorPatchVersion>-<FixVersion>` e.g [v.1.2.4.5]
- What 'major patch' or 'minor patch' mean ?
It is arbitrary and related to effort amount that was invested in implementing particular functionality.

**Why another Kafka Apache tool ?**  
This application is mainly designed for testers/developers who want to quickly check/verify some kafka cluster properties 
(or send/receive few messages) without the need to use original console scripts provided with kafka installation.
Obviously functionality of KMT is much more limited than original scripts in favour of simplicity and usability   
The goals of creating this tool were:
- No dependency to zookeeper 
  - User should not be forced to provide zookeeper ip and port to work with kafka.
  Only ip and port of kafka cluster should be enough.
- Application should be self sufficient - no additional 'servers' or backend should be required to use it.
- No installation should be required. It should work out of the box.  Just type `java -jar  <application.jar>`
