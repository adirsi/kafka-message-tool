### BUGS ###
      bug: when topic config names changes, related sender config combobox does not always refresh this new name with dropdown list (but it is refreshed in the 'selected' value)
      bug: log window has 'save to file' popup menu option but does not do anything
### TODO ###

todo: big feature : enable providing multiple bootstrap servers in broker config
    this will cause lots of compilations
        e.g. checking that all bootstrap servers belong to the same cluster
        e.g. detection that some nodes (or all) goes does down during listeners working
        e.g. check that all advertised listeners from each node is accessible
        (but maybe only one valid advertised listener is enough ?)
            question: how to detect that nodes with 'accessible' advertised listeners went down but the node(s) with
                inaccessible advertised listeners are up ?




todo: add word wrap enable/disable checkbox for all CodeArea / LogArea
todo: refactor kafka proxy class
todo: add isSuccess bar with popup hints (similar in Intelij IDEA) to communicate with the user, and remove 'logging window'
todo: add config opiton - add opition: don't show warning about invalid configuraiton



### TODO_LOW_PRIORITY ###
todo: feature: replace 'isSuccess' button with 'connect/disconnect' . Connect will result in fetching info every e.g. 1 second
todo: low_priority: report in details inconsistent configuration (which node has what settings)
todo: low_priority: when fetching new broker, if configuration on some tab does need to be updated, do not refresh it
todo: low_priority save user sorting type for topic (only during program work - dont need to be persistent)
todo: add handling DEL button in LIstVIew to delete config
todo: add handling INS button in listView to add new config
todo: add gui configuration window (e.g. define all timeouts in application instead of hardcoded values)
todo: add checkbox to NOT send empty messages (if they get evaluated to empty string)
todo: add 'after EACH message' to be 'symmetric' when sending message template is concerned
todo: add wordwrap checkbox for all text areas

### NOT DONE - DONT KNOW SOLUTION ###
expand table column width to content
print replication factor for topic in summary


### Add to future config window
 - should resize column width to content
